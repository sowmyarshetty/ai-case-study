## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Use chat gpt to summarize 
 The problem of inefficiencies in radiology workflows and the need for improved patient care through timely and accurate medical imaging analysis. Key issues include:
Delayed Diagnosis: Radiologists often face delays in reviewing critical medical images due to high workloads and the prioritization of studies, which can lead to significant impacts on patient outcomes. 
Workflow Inefficiencies: Traditional methods of managing imaging tasks can be cumbersome, consuming valuable time that could be better spent on patient care. 
Integration of AI: The challenge of effectively integrating AI technologies into existing medical imaging systems to enhance efficiency and collaboration among various stakeholders in healthcare.

Workflow improvements 
- The primary area being focused by AI is to scan  medical images as soon as possible after acquisition, before they reach the radiologist.
- REiLis open platform would trigger multiple AI engines to scan these studies to provide valuable imaging analytics .  

- Reprioritize work list 
- AI findings can flag critical findings and categorize as urgent which otherwise might not be seen by a radiologist for 20, 30 minutes or more if originally not categorized as urgent
- AI can  communicate with appropriate physicians.  If, for example, we see a bleed in the brain of an unread study, AI can send communication out to a group of physicians so that it’s flagged as even more immediate as opposed to just being placed at the top of a worklist.
-AI will be able to help providers better care for patients in the emergency department, digesting all of the available information surrounding a patient and their history and giving it to physicians in a comprehensive view within the short amount of time they have to make critical decisions.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Our REiLI platform will serve as the intelligent layer between AI imaging analytics engines and AI-enabled applications like PACS. It is basically collaboration of AI with human and other AI .  Our platform will provide the rules of use for AI engines, the management of AI results and the distribution of results to AI use cases within clinical applications, and it will offer an open API so providers can take advantage of third-party AI engines or their own AI work. We are focusing a lot of attention on the use cases within applications like PACS, so having an open platform to allow other third-party AI engines to use our platform and make their results accessible to our use cases just further strengthens the REiLI solution for users.

## Results

Medical imaging saves millions of lives each year. It helps doctors to detect and diagnose a wide range of diseases, from cancer and appendicitis to stroke and heart disease.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is supporting real-world solutions across the healthcare space, including medical imaging. With help from AI, imaging technicians don’t even need to rely on their eyes alone to identify potential concerns.

AI has the potential to revolutionize the advanced medical imaging industry. Already, AI is being used to help physicians sift through large volumes of scans and return diagnostic insights, giving them more time to oversee treatments and work directly with patients. AI-driven analytics and predictive analytics can even improve the accuracy and speed of decision-making around treatment options.

Google’s DeepMind can read 3D retinal OCT scans and diagnose 50 different ophthalmic conditions with 99% accuracy. It can detect indicators of eye disease. It can also rank patients by urgency and recommend treatment. These capabilities could cut down on the delay between scan and treatment. This allows patients to get sight-saving treatments in time.
iCAD’s “ProFound AI” is a solution for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). It helps radiologists to view each tissue layer and thereby detect cancer up to 8 percent sooner on average. This can reduce radiologists’ time spent reading breast scans by more than 50%.
Siemens Healthineers and Intel partnered to explore how AI can improve cardiac MRI diagnostics. Currently, cardiologists need to segment many different parts of the heart in their imaging—an incredibly time-consuming task. This AI-enabled instant segmentation technology enables specialists to see more patients each day.


* What has been the business impact of this company so far? This is AI generated
Enhanced Clinical Efficiency:
By providing a unified view of patient images across different modalities, clinicians can access all relevant information quickly, leading to faster diagnosis and treatment decisions. 
Improved Collaboration:
The platform enables seamless collaboration between different departments within a healthcare organization, facilitating multidisciplinary consultations and streamlined care pathways. 
Reduced IT Complexity:
With a centralized system, healthcare organizations can minimize the need to manage multiple vendor imaging solutions, reducing IT overhead and simplifying system updates. 
Scalability and Flexibility:
The cloud-based infrastructure allows for flexible deployment and scalability to accommodate growing data needs and changing healthcare demands.

The integration of artificial intelligence into radiology PACS and enterprise imaging systems has become a big topic of discussion with IT vendors over the past couple years. This has become a bigger question from hospitals and radiology groups as there are now about 400 radiology related AI algorithms that have U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance.   these algorithms are still relatively new to the market. Vendors are taking different approaches to how they integrate them into their radiology IT workflows. 
However, since there are no standards set for how AI interfaces with various IT systems, she said it will take time. This is why many radiology IT PACS vendors are now partnering with a set number of AI companies that they feel offer a good product and work together to enable these types of seamless integrations. 
"To do this for 200-plus vendors is not realistic for any vendor to do, so there are still a lot of unknowns for IT vendors. Like, which AI vendor should I partner with, because you have 200-plus, and most of them are limited to three or four applications in terms of mammography, lung, brain and a few others. There is a lot of repetition currently in the market and there is not a lot of consolidation yet to have a top 10 or top 20 clear winners," Thomson said. 

Even asking radiology end users what vendors they prefer, there is no clear answer because 10 hospitals will give 10 different answers, she said.

"Radiology wants the productivity and efficiency that AI has the potential to give it, but the buyers are increasingly risk averse. They have a limited budget and they can't risk the potential value that an AI algorithm costs compared to a workflow upgrade or a new clinical viewer, something that they know is proven and will benefit value for them as an organization," she explained.

The risk of using AI and not seeing changes in workflow efficiency or patient outcomes, and concerns about liability risk, has caused AI to drop down on many priority lists, she said.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
- 1000 images in one patients CAT scan. The AI helps by highlighting which of the 1000 images has an important finding in it. In many remote parts of the world where there is not access to radiologists , AI can support non radiologist doctors in what to look for. It gives them confidence that they are making the right decisions. At University Radiology group (13 hospital and 23 outpatient offices ) one of the largest private practice groups in America.
