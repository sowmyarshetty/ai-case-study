# AI Case Study in the field of Radiology to support diagnosis by providing Image Processing technolgies with AI 

### Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have made an immense impact on enterprise imaging in recent years and this impact continues to grow each and every day. The need for improved patient care through timely and accurate medical imaging analysis has revolutionized the field of medical technolgies with cutting-edge AI innovations.  The team at FUJIFILM Medical Systems U.S.A., Inc. (Fujifilm) has been leading the industry with its innovation and support of radiologists every step of the way.

Medical imaging saves millions of lives each year. It helps doctors to detect and diagnose a wide range of diseases, from cancer and appendicitis to stroke and heart disease.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is supporting real-world solutions across the healthcare space, including medical imaging. With help from AI, imaging technicians don’t even need to rely on their eyes alone to identify potential concerns.

AI has the potential to revolutionize the advanced medical imaging industry. Already, AI is being used to help physicians sift through large volumes of scans and return diagnostic insights, giving them more time to oversee treatments and work directly with patients. AI-driven analytics and predictive analytics can even improve the accuracy and speed of decision-making around treatment options.

## Name of the Company : 
### FUJIFILM Healthcare 
### Legal Name - FUJIFILM Holdings Americas Corporation
 FUJIFILM Healthcare is a subsidiary of FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation which has 310 consolidated subsidiaries worldwide.   Fujifilm's healthcare history began in 1936 when the company started making X-ray film, and has since evolved to include a wide range of products and services:including diagnostic imaging, ultrasound systems,CT, and MRI.

## Use case the project is trying to solve 

* Delayed Diagnosis: Radiologists often face delays in reviewing critical medical images due to high workloads and the prioritization of studies, which can lead to significant impacts on patient outcomes. The primary area being focused by AI is to scan  medical images as soon as possible after acquisition, before they reach the radiologist.
* Workflow Inefficiencies: Traditional methods of managing imaging tasks can be cumbersome, consuming valuable time that could be better spent on patient care. 
* Integration of AI: The challenge of effectively integrating AI technologies into existing medical imaging systems to enhance efficiency and collaboration among various stakeholders in healthcare.

## What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
* The Synapse® Enterprise Imaging portfolio , Synapse® 7x , Fujifilm’s next-generation enterprise imaging solution unifies the products within the company’s Synapse portfolio — including Radiology PACS, Cardiology PACS, 3D Advanced Visualization, VNA and Fujifilm’s AI-enabled platform REiLI® — on one common viewing platform.

*  Integral to Synapse 7x, the Synapse Radiology and Cardiology PACS functionality is developed with ongoing direction from radiologists and cardiologists.

* Fujifilm’s Synapse PACS is a robust server-side rendering solution that helps streamline diagnostic image analysis, interpretation, and reporting for radiology and cardiology studies across the enterprise.

* REiLI platform serves as the intelligent layer between AI imaging analytics engines and AI-enabled applications like PACS. It is basically collaboration of AI with human and other AI .  This platform will provide the rules of use for AI engines, the management of AI results and the distribution of results to AI use cases within clinical applications, and it also  offers an open API so providers can take advantage of third-party AI engines or their own AI work. Having an open platform allows other third-party AI engines to use the Synapse® platform and make their results accessible to our use cases which further strengthens the data being made available to the stakeholders.

   * REiLis open platform would trigger multiple AI engines to scan these studies to provide valuable imaging analytics .  
   * Reprioritize work list - AI findings can flag critical findings and categorize as urgent which otherwise might not be seen by a radiologist for 20, 30 minutes or more if originally not categorized as urgent
   * AI can  communicate with appropriate physicians.  If, for example, we see a bleed in the brain of an unread study, AI can send communication out to a group of physicians so that it’s flagged as even more immediate as opposed to just being placed at the top of a worklist.
   * AI will be able to help providers better care for patients in the emergency department, digesting all of the available information surrounding a patient and their history and giving it to physicians in a comprehensive view within the short amount of time they have to make critical decisions. 

* Fujifilm’s Synapse PACS is a robust server-side rendering solution that helps streamline diagnostic image analysis, interpretation, and reporting for radiology and cardiology studies across the enterprise.

## Recommendations
#### Following would be my recommendations 

* Synapse® Enterprise Imaging portfolio with Reilis AI platform - using this open, vendor neutral platform, you can integrate with various AI models. Data from other AI models can be integrated, resulting in automatic and rapid identification and prioritization of tasks. This enables improved reading accuracy by radiloglosts or cphysicians or clinical staff, reduce reading time and improving workflow 


####  Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* Medical imaging saves millions of lives each year. It helps doctors to detect and diagnose a wide range of diseases, from cancer and appendicitis to stroke and heart disease.
With help from AI, imaging technicians don’t even need to rely on their eyes alone to identify potential concerns.

* 1000 images in one patients CAT scan. The AI helps by highlighting which of the 1000 images has an important finding in it. Using this product will help physicians with diagnostic insights, giving them more time to oversee treatments and work directly with patients. This will improve the accuracy and speed of decision-making around treatment options.

* In many remote parts of the world where there is not access to radiologists , AI can support non radiologist doctors in what to look for. It gives them confidence that they are making the right decisions.
