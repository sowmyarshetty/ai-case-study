# AI in Radiology - Fujifilm HealthCare
## Summary 
> Fujifilm Healthcare, a subsidiary of FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, has positioned itself at the forefront of the medical imaging industry by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its imaging solutions. This case study explores the challenges faced by radiologists, the innovative solutions offered by Fujifilm, and the significant impact of AI on improving diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.

## Introduction 
>  Medical imaging saves millions of lives each year. It helps doctors to detect and diagnose a wide range of diseases, from cancer and appendicitis to stroke and heart disease. Yet Radiologists often face delays in reviewing critical medical images due to high workloads.  Also in rural places where there is not easy access to radiologists, the process is further delayed.  Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have made an immense impact on enterprise imaging in recent years and this impact continues to grow each and every day.  FUJIFILM's Healthcare division has been leading the industry with its innovation and support of radiologists every step of the way. Fujifilm's Synapse® Enterprise Imaging portfolio, along with its REiLI® AI platform, exemplifies how AI can revolutionize the radiology field.

## Use case : Challenges in Radiology 
### Key Issues: 
* Delayed Diagnosis: Radiologists often face delays in reviewing critical medical images due to high workloads and the prioritization of studies
* Workflow Inefficiencies: Traditional methods of managing imaging tasks can be cumbersome, consuming valuable time that could be better spent on patient care. 
* Integration of AI: The challenge of effectively integrating AI technologies into existing medical imaging systems to enhance efficiency and collaboration among various stakeholders in healthcare remains a hurdle for many healthcare organizations.

## AI as a Solution 
AI technologies can scan medical images immediately post-acquisition, prioritizing critical findings and enabling faster diagnostic insights. This capability not only enhances patient care but also optimizes the workflow for radiologists.

## Technological Implementation
 Fujifilm's Synpase product has Microsoft Azure as its strategic cloud partner. This product leverages several components of Microsoft Azure 
   * Azure Virtual Machines (Vms)
   * Azure Blob Storage 
   * Azure SQL Database
   * Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
   * Azure Active Directory (AD)
   * Azure Security Center
   * Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics 
   * Azure Backup and Recovery 

Fujifilm implemented its Synapse product on Microsoft Azure through a combination of strategic architecture , data migration and integration techniques 
* Cloud Infrastructure Design and Setup - Traditionaly the Synapse platform was deployed on-premises, it had to be re-architected for cloud infrastructure using Microsoft Azure services 
* Data Migration - Large amount of clinical and imaging data has been moved from local storage to Azure Blob Storage . This process involved Data Anonymization and data encryption to comply with HIPAA 
* Containerization and Microservices Architecture - Fujifilm uses Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to deploy Synapse as a microservices based architecture.
